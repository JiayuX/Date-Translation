# Date-Translation
In this project, we build a LSTM-based seq2seq model with attention mechanism to translate human-readable date to machine-readable date.

The training, validation and test data are generated.

Text data is preprocessed prior to the training. The text data preprocessing is done using a customized class and functions written in the 'preprocessing.py' file.
